Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently replacing simple tasks and some major tasks. Suppose we are to assume that AI is to incrementally become better, it would change how we live our lives. If it becomes even stronger, it changes the future of humanity. If it becomes even more powerful, then it controls our future. If it becomes cosmic and godlike, then it will probably leave us alone, to pursue mundane tasks that it had initially taken over to keep us busy and going in circles, and we’ll be back to where we are now, confused. Perhaps we are here. Perhaps, we have been left alone. What makes us think the cosmic energy didn't actually start as a non-intelligent machine or micro-organism, and eventually helped humanity advance, and eventually restarted humanity to keep us in the cycle on unknown-known-unkown, which is purposefully aligned to lead itself into nowhere, but more unknown-known-unkown. Then, we’d spend a century learning that all we’ve learnt in the past century is not true, oh that's what we are doing! So, maybe we are indeed alone, not because we are, but because we are meant to be!
